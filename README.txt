This assignment is implemented using Python 3.5. The code implements naive bayes algorithm and produces the accuracy of the algorith with and without the inclusion of stop words 

Project Structure:
------------------
- Naive_Bayes.py
To run the code, use the following command:
-------------------------------------------
--> python main_program.py <Path to Training_set_ham><Path to Training_set_spam><Path to Testing_set_ham><Path to Testing_set_spam><lambda -regularization term ><iteration><learning rate>
Example:
--------
  python main_project.py train/ham train/spam test/ham test/spam 0.001 10 0.001
